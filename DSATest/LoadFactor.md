In the context of hash tables, the load factor (sometimes called the fill factor) is a measure that determines how full the hash table is. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of entries in the hash table to the total size or capacity of the hash table.
```
Load factor = (Number of entries in the hash table) / (Total size or capacity of the hash table)
```

The load factor is an important concept in hash tables because it directly affects the performance of operations like insertion, deletion, and lookup.

A low load factor means that the hash table is sparsely populated, and there is a lower probability of collisions (where two or more keys map to the same index in the hash table). As a result, operations can be performed efficiently.

However, if the load factor becomes too high (i.e., the hash table is densely populated), the probability of collisions increases, leading to more time spent in resolving these collisions. This can degrade the performance of the hash table operations, making them less efficient.

#### It's calculated by dividing the number of items (key-value pairs) stored in the hash table by the total capacity or size of the hash table... A high load factor can slow down operations like inserting, deleting, or finding items in the hash table. To prevent this, hash tables often have a maximum load factor threshold. When the load factor exceeds this threshold, the hash table is resized (made bigger) to accommodate more items and reduce the load factor back to an acceptable level. Maintaining a reasonable load factor is important for keeping the hash table efficient and avoiding performance issues.
