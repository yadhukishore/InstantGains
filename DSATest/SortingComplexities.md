Sure! Here’s a detailed explanation of the time complexities for various sorting algorithms in their best, average, and worst cases:

### 1. Bubble Sort
Bubble sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

- **Best Case (O(n)):** This occurs when the array is already sorted. In this case, the algorithm makes a single pass and finds no elements out of order.
- **Average Case (O(n²)):** On average, the elements are in random order, and bubble sort must compare and possibly swap each pair of elements multiple times.
- **Worst Case (O(n²)):** This occurs when the array is in reverse order. The algorithm must make multiple passes through the list, each time comparing and swapping every element.

### 2. Selection Sort
Selection sort divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items that is built up from left to right and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items.

- **Best Case (O(n²)):** No matter the initial order of elements, the algorithm always scans the entire list to find the minimum element.
- **Average Case (O(n²)):** The performance does not depend on the initial order of elements.
- **Worst Case (O(n²)):** The performance does not change with the initial order of elements.

### 3. Insertion Sort
Insertion sort builds the sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly picking the next item and inserting it into its correct position.

- **Best Case (O(n)):** This occurs when the array is already sorted. The algorithm only makes a single pass with no swaps necessary.
- **Average Case (O(n²)):** In average scenarios, elements need to be compared and swapped multiple times.
- **Worst Case (O(n²)):** This occurs when the array is sorted in reverse order. Each new element needs to be compared with all the sorted elements.

### 4. Merge Sort
Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.

- **Best Case (O(n log n)):** The division into halves and merging process always takes O(n log n) time.
- **Average Case (O(n log n)):** Regardless of the initial order, the algorithm always performs consistently.
- **Worst Case (O(n log n)):** Similar to the average and best cases, the performance is unaffected by the initial order of elements.

### 5. Quick Sort
Quick sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks an element as a pivot, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the subarrays.

- **Best Case (O(n log n)):** This occurs when the pivot divides the array into two equal halves at each step.
- **Average Case (O(n log n)):** On average, the pivot divides the array into reasonably balanced subarrays.
- **Worst Case (O(n²)):** This occurs when the pivot divides the array into very unbalanced subarrays, such as when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot.

### 6. Heap Sort
Heap sort converts the array into a binary heap and then repeatedly extracts the maximum element to build the sorted array.

- **Best Case (O(n log n)):** The process of building the heap and sorting is consistently O(n log n).
- **Average Case (O(n log n)):** The performance remains the same regardless of the initial order of elements.
- **Worst Case (O(n log n)):** The algorithm’s efficiency does not depend on the initial order of elements.

### 7. Counting Sort
Counting sort assumes that the elements are integers within a specific range and counts the occurrences of each element.

- **Best Case (O(n + k)):** The performance is dependent on both the number of elements (n) and the range of elements (k).
- **Average Case (O(n + k)):** The performance remains the same regardless of the initial order of elements.
- **Worst Case (O(n + k)):** The performance is primarily dependent on the range of the input values.

### 8. Radix Sort
Radix sort processes the digits of each number, sorting the numbers based on each digit.

- **Best Case (O(nk)):** The performance depends on the number of elements (n) and the number of digits (k).
- **Average Case (O(nk)):** The performance remains consistent with the best case.
- **Worst Case (O(nk)):** The performance does not change with the initial order of elements.

### 9. Bucket Sort
Bucket sort distributes elements into a number of buckets and then sorts each bucket individually.

- **Best Case (O(n + k)):** This occurs when the elements are uniformly distributed across the buckets, and each bucket contains a small number of elements.
- **Average Case (O(n + k)):** The performance depends on the distribution of elements and the sorting method used for the buckets.
- **Worst Case (O(n²)):** This occurs when all elements end up in a single bucket.
