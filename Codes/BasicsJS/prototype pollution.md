Sure, let me explain prototype pollution in simple terms.

In JavaScript, objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype object. This prototype object is like a blueprint or a template for the object.

Prototype pollution is when an attacker can manipulate or "pollute" this prototype object in an unexpected way, causing the object to behave differently than intended.

Here's a simple example:

Let's say you have an object called `userInfo` that stores a user's name and age like this:

```javascript
const userInfo = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25
};
```

Now, there's a function that allows you to add more properties to this object:

```javascript
function addProperty(obj, key, value) {
  obj[key] = value;
}
```

An attacker could potentially call this function like this:

```javascript
addProperty(userInfo, "__proto__.maliciousProperty", "Malicious Value");
```

Here, the key is `"__proto__.maliciousProperty"`. The `__proto__` is a special property that points to the prototype of the object.

So, instead of adding a regular property to `userInfo`, the attacker has added a property to the prototype object itself.

This means that all objects inheriting from this prototype will now have the `maliciousProperty` property, which could lead to unexpected behavior or even security vulnerabilities.

To prevent prototype pollution, developers should carefully validate and sanitize any user input or external data that is used to set object properties, and avoid blindly merging objects or adding properties based on user-supplied keys.
