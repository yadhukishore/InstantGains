# why we are using redux for this wishlist? instead of directly adding it to the backend?

Using Redux for managing the wishlist in your application, rather than directly interacting with the backend, has several advantages. Here are the key reasons:

### 1. **Instant Feedback and Responsiveness:**
   - **User Experience:** By using Redux, you can provide an immediate response to the user when they add or remove items from their wishlist. The state is updated instantly in the frontend, making the application feel faster and more responsive.
   - **Optimistic UI:** Users see changes immediately, even before they are persisted in the backend. If the backend operation fails, you can roll back the state, but the user doesn't experience a delay.

### 2. **State Management:**
   - **Centralized State:** Redux centralizes the wishlist state, making it easier to manage and access from different components across your application. This avoids prop drilling and allows any component to interact with the wishlist easily.
   - **Scalability:** As your application grows, managing state globally through Redux can help maintain clean and organized code. If you add more features, like filtering or sorting the wishlist, Redux can handle these complexities efficiently.

### 3. **Offline Support:**
   - **Temporary Storage:** Redux can temporarily store the wishlist data even when the user is offline. Once the user is back online, you can sync the changes with the backend.
   - **Caching:** Redux can act as a caching layer, reducing the need to make frequent API calls to the backend, which can be beneficial for performance.

### 4. **Performance Considerations:**
   - **Reducing Backend Load:** If every interaction with the wishlist required a backend request, it could lead to performance bottlenecks, especially under heavy load. By managing the state in Redux, you reduce the number of API calls.
   - **Batching Operations:** You can batch multiple wishlist operations and send them to the backend in a single API call, which can optimize performance.

### 5. **Consistency Across UI:**
   - **Global Access:** Redux allows consistent access to the wishlist state across different components. For example, a "Wishlist" icon in the navbar can display the number of items in the wishlist by simply accessing the Redux state.
   - **Derived State:** You can derive additional states, like showing if a course is already in the wishlist, directly from the Redux state without needing to query the backend.

### 6. **Simplicity in Testing:**
   - **Easier Testing:** With Redux, you can easily mock the wishlist state and test different components' behavior without needing to set up a backend environment. This simplifies unit testing and ensures your UI behaves as expected under various scenarios.

### When to Use Direct Backend Interaction:
Directly interacting with the backend for each wishlist action might be preferable in cases where:
   - **Strict Data Consistency:** If it's crucial that the wishlist in the UI always reflects the exact state on the server, you might opt for direct backend interactions.
   - **Security Concerns:** If there's a significant concern about users manipulating the client-side state, direct backend interactions can mitigate risks.

However, a common approach is to use a combination of both: manage the wishlist locally with Redux for a responsive UI and synchronize it with the backend in the background. This gives you the best of both worldsâ€”great user experience and data persistence.
